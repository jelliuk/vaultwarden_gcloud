# Vaultwarden self-hosted on Google Cloud for Free

Vaultwarden installation optimized for Google Cloud's 'always free' e2-micro compute instance

> _Note: if you follow these instructions the end product is a self-hosted instance of vaultwarden running in the cloud and will be free **unless** you exceed the 1GB egress per month or have egress to China or Australia. I talk about best practices to help avoid China/AUS egress, but there's a chance you can get charges from that so please keep that in mind._

This is a quick-start guide. Read about this project in more detail [here](https://bradford.la/2020/self-host-vaultwarden-on-google-cloud).

## Features

* Vaultwarden self-hosted
* Automatic https certificate management through Caddy 2 proxy
* Dynamic DNS updates through ddclient
* Blocking brute-force attempts with fail2ban
* Country-wide blocking through iptables and ipset

## Pre-requisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

1. A Google Cloud account
2. A Cloudflare-managed DNS site with an A record ready for vaultwarden

## Step 1: Set up Google Cloud `e2-micro` Compute Engine Instance

Google Cloud offers an '[always free](https://cloud.google.com/free/)' tier of their Compute Engine with one virtual core and ~600 MB of RAM (about 150 MB free depending on which OS you installed). [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) runs well under these constraints; it's written in Rust and an ideal candidate for a micro instance. 

Go to [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) and open a Cloud Shell. You may also create the instance manually following [the constraints of the free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier). In the Cloud Shell enter the following command to build the properly spec'd machine: 

```bash
$ gcloud compute instances create vaultwarden \
    --machine-type e2-micro \
    --zone us-east1-b \
    --image-project cos-cloud \
    --image-family cos-stable \
    --boot-disk-size=30GB \
    --tags http-server,https-server \
    --scopes compute-rw
```

You may change the zone to be closer to you or customize the name (`vaultwarden`), but most of the other values should remain the same. 

Next, create firewall rules to allow traffic to your VM. vaultwarden only serves encrypted traffic over HTTPS, but port 80 is needed for the Let's Encrypt challenges served by Caddy:
```bash
$ gcloud compute firewall-rules create vaultwarden-http-ingress --action allow --target-tags http-server --rules tcp:80
$ gcloud compute firewall-rules create vaultwarden-https-ingress --action allow --target-tags https-server --rules tcp:443
```

## Step 2: Pull and Configure Project

Enter a shell on the new instance and clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jelliuk/vaultwarden_gcloud.git
$ cd vaultwarden_gcloud
```

Set up the docker-compose alias by using the included script:

```bash
$ sh utilities/install-alias.sh
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version x.y.z, build abc
```

### Configure Environmental Variables with `.env`

The provided `.env.template` needs to be updated and copied to `.env` and filled out; filling it out is self-explanitory and requires certain values such as a domain name, Cloudflare API tokens, etc. 

Example:
```bash
$ cd vaultwarden_gcloud
$ nano .env.template
```
When saving within nano, you can rename the output to .env

Be aware that there is an optional backup section that allows you to have an encrypted backup regularly backed up and emailed or synced to cloud storage. More documentation on this feature is available [here](https://bradford.la/2020/self-host-vaultwarden-on-google-cloud/#configure-vaultwarden-backups-optional).

### Configure `fail2ban` (_optional_)

`fail2ban` stops brute-force attempts at your vault. To configure how long a ban is and how many attempts will trigger a ban, edit `fail2ban/jail.d/jail.local`:

```conf
bantime = 24h <- how long to enforce the ip ban
maxretry = 3  <- number of times to retry until a ban occurs
```

This will work out of the box - no `fail2ban` configuration is needed unless you want e-mail alerts of bans. 

If you want to remove e-mail alerts of bans, follow the instructions in `fail2ban/jail.d/jail.local` by commenting (#) and entering `destemail` and `sender` and commenting (#) the `action_mwl` action in the `vaultwarden` and `vaultwarden-admin` jails in the same file.


### Configure Country-wide Blocking (_optional_)

The `countryblock` container will block ip addresses from countries specified in `.env` under `COUNTRIES`. China, Hong Kong, and Australia (CN, HK, AU) are blocked by default because Google Cloud will charge egress to those countries under the free tier. You may add any country you like to that list, or clear it out entirely if you don't want to block those countries. Be aware, however, you'll probably be charged for any traffic to those countries, even from bots or crawlers. 

This country-wide blocklist will be updated daily at midnight, but you can change the `COUNTRYBLOCK_SCHEDULE` variable in `.env` to suit your needs. 

These block-lists are pulled from <www.ipdeny.com> on each update. 

### Configure Automatic Rebooting After Updates (_optional_)

Container-Optimized OS will automatically update itself, but the update will only be applied after a reboot. In order to ensure that you are using the most current operating system software, you can set a boot script that waits until an update has been applied to schedule a reboot.

Before you start, ensure you have `compute-rw` scope for your vaultwarden compute vm. If you used the `gcloud` command above, it includes that scope. If not, go to your Google Cloud console and edit the "Cloud API access scopes" to have "Compute Engine" show "Read Write". You need to shut down your compute vm in order to change this.

Modify the script to set your local timezone and the time to schedule reboots: set the `TZ=` and `TIME=` variables in `utilities/reboot-on-update.sh`. By default the script will schedule reboots for 06:00 UTC. 

From within your compute vm console, type the command `toolbox`. From within `toolbox`, find the `utilities` folder within `vaultwarden_gcloud`. `toolbox` mounts the host filesystem under `/media/root`, so go there to find the folder. It will likely be in `/media/root/home/<google account name>/vaultwarden_gcloud/utilities` - `cd` to that folder.

Next, use `gcloud` to add the `reboot-on-update.sh` script to your vm's boot script metadata with the `add-metadata` [command](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript#startupscriptrunninginstances):

```bash
gcloud compute instances add-metadata <instance> --metadata-from-file startup-script=reboot-on-update.sh
```

You can confirm that your startup script has been added in your instance details under "Custom metadata" on the Compute Engine Console. 

Next, restart your vm with the command `$ sudo reboot`. Once your vm has rebooted, you can confirm that the startup script was run with the command:

```bash
$ sudo journalctl -u google-startup-scripts.service
```

Now the script will wait until a reboot is pending and then schedule a reboot for the time configured in the script.

## Step 3: Update DNS within CloudFlare

Login to CloudFlare Control Panel and add an A Record for your chosen FQDN for the service with the External IP Address within Google Control Panel.

https://dash.cloudflare.com/

Perform ping <FQDN> with your local computer and ensure that the returned IP Address is the same as External IP Address within Google Control Panel.  Note you may need to refresh your DNS Cache to ensure the IP is correctly known.

## Step 4: Start Services

To start up, use `docker-compose`:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You can now use your browser to visit your new vaultwarden site. 

## Step 5: Update DDclient Config

Ensure you are in the necessary directory (vaultwarden_gcloud) and edit the DDclient Config to auto-update the DNS Record you have created.

```bash
$ nano DDclient/ddclient.conf
```

Uncomment the following line:

```
use=web, web=checkip.dyndns.org/, web-skip='IP Address'
```

The below details provided below as guidance for CloudFlare:

```
##
## CloudFlare (www.cloudflare.com)
##
protocol=cloudflare,        \
zone=<TLD>,      \
ttl=1,                      \
login=<CloudFlare Login - Email Address>,     \
password=<Global API>  \
<FQDN as defined in the .env file>
```

To validate the configuration:

```
$ docker container logs ddclient
```

You'll see the following message if everything is working:

SUCCESS: "FQDN" -- Updated Successfully to "External IP Address"

## Step 6: Create Weekly Snapshot Schedule to protect VM: (_optional_)

In the Cloud Shell enter the following command (amend any of the settings like region, if you have located the VM in a different location):

```
gcloud compute resource-policies create snapshot-schedule weekly-snapshot \
    --description "Weekly Snapshot - Saturday 01:00" \
    --max-retention-days 7 \
    --start-time 01:00 \
    --weekly-schedule saturday \
    --region us-east1 \
    --on-source-disk-delete apply-retention-policy \
    --storage-location US
```

## Step 7: Assign the vaultwarden_RS Disk to the Snapshot Schedule to Protect the VM: (_optional_)

In the Cloud Shell enter the following command (amend any of the settings if you have adjusted values):

```
gcloud compute disks add-resource-policies vaultwarden-rs \
    --resource-policies weekly-snapshot \
    --zone us-east1-b
```

## f1-micro to e2-micro Migration

Follow these steps to migrate from the previous free tier f1-micro to the new free tier e2-micro.

1.  Shut down your VM instance
2.  Edit the vm instance to machine type e2-micro using the google cloud GUI or cloud shell. 
3.  Boot the VM again and everything should start as before. 

Note that after shutting down and booting the new machine type, it may take a while for the DNS record's TTL to expire and point to the new IP which gets changed after a shutdown.
